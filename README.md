Playing with new Nextauth.

On this project I've worked with new nextauth. You can sign up with google/github or with credentials. bob@bob.com, pw: test (normal user), zzzz@zzzz.zzzz, pw: zzzz (admin user rights) - you will have access to page create user. And will be able to create a normal user. Data will be stored in MongoDB. Password hashed, so its kinda protected. It could show 500 error. Just refresh page. This all projects ssr, so sometimes vercel free plan doesn't render it for first time.
